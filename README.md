# DailyGreeting
It greets you every morning :>

You can customize the greetings by accessing the 'messages.json' file and editing it to your heart's desire. Anything goes!

I'm planning to make a whole cutscene where your spouse or someone you have high friendship with will visit you with a random chance, and will say something nice or have a nice chat with you. This could, potentially, add to the story, and make the player's relationship to the characters feel more real, especially for first time players.
